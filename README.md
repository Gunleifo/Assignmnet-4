HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

    Make sure to have port 5000, 5001 and 5002 free

    Then open three terminals and navigate them all to the folder with the code

    In the first terminal type: go run . 0
    In the second terminal type: go run . 1
    In the third terminal type: go run . 2

    If working each process should output trying to dial "port number for other processes"
    This should be continued by some messages showing how the token is being sent around the procceses in a token ring
